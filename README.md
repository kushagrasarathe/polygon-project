# ABOUT THE PROJECT

**Caze** is designed to be single destination platform solution for creators as well consumers of all kind viz. NFT Artists, Music artists, etc. It aims at replacing the traditional centralized platform based subscription model with the decentralized NFT based subscription ownership. 
We identified the gaps present in the present subscription based platforms where both the creators as well as the customers are not being rewarded properly.
We took various initiatves to bridge this gap so as to esatablish an effective creators based economy.
